# Tic-Tac-Typescript using React hooks
*This project is based on Alexei Darmin's "Building TicTacToe with React Typescript"*

*Disclaimer:*It's probably unwise of me to install your initial package with npm and then use yarn to install the later packages. However, this is a little learning experience, not a to-scale web-app.
