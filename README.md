# Tic-Tac-Typescript using React hooks

*Disclaimer: It's probably unwise of me to install your initial package with npm and then use yarn to install the later packages. However, this is a little learning experience, not a to-scale web-app.*

*Second Disclaimer: This project is BY NO MEANS a best practice. It is a means of learning both TS in React and the new React hooks mechanism.*
